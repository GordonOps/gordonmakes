# Lab: Microsoft Azure Fundamentals

## Abstract
As my college program begins the course MS Azure 1: Azure Administration we open with a unit based on the AZ-900 series of Learning Paths on **learn.microsoft.com**. Next week we take on the AZ104 preparatory material which leads to the Azure Administrator Associate level Exam. 

The Learning Goals for the series are quoted below:
>After completing this learning path, you'll be able to:
>
>*Understand the benefits of cloud computing in Azure and how it can save you time and money
>*Explain cloud concepts such as high availability, scalability, elasticity, agility, and disaster recovery
>*Describe core Azure architecture components such as subscriptions, management groups, resources and resource groups
>*Summarize geographic distribution concepts such as Azure regions, region pairs, and availability zones

## Method
This lab is essentially to review the material in these 6 curriculum subjects are provided by Learn.Microsoft.com in 3 Learning Paths
1.[Part 1: Describe core Azure concepts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/az-900-describe-cloud-concepts/)
2. [Azure Fundamentals: Describe Azure architecture and services](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/azure-fundamentals-describe-azure-architecture-services/)
3. [Azure Fundamentals: Describe Azure management and governance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/describe-azure-management-governance/)

## Observations

There is a clear misalignment between what the learning content writer set out to do, 6 courses and what they actually produced: 3 Learning Paths. Each of the 6 courses linked to one of the 3 paths which made it confusing to get a lay of the land: understanding what material is even being studied. 


## Conclusion

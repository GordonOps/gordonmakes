      <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>My Azure Administration course has laboratory assignments that make use of <em>Microsoft Learn for Educators</em>’s aka MSLE’s cloud powered VM based <a href="https://msle.learnondemand.net/User/Login?ReturnUrl=%2F">learning environment</a> hosted by the vendor <a href="https://www.skillable.com/">Skillable</a>.</p>

<p>My first assignment has 2 tasks to be completed within the MSLE environment. Task 1: Create an Azure resource, Task 2: Create an Azure Virtual Machine.</p>

<h2 id="method">Method</h2>
<p>Instruction for logging into the environment were provided by an unlisted YouTube video. The login process specified the applicable content was AZ-900. Inside the learning environment there were step by step instructions for completing the 2 Tasks under Module 1 and 2.</p>

<h2 id="observations">Observations</h2>
<p>The MSLE was registered using the key provided and school email and the EULA was agreed to. The T00A series of labs has 5 required labs available to launch up to 10 times. Below is a challenge test and 27 supporting labs that are all not required and all able to launch 3 times.</p>

<p>The lab Module 01 was completed and a verification screengrab was captured. Each step was identical to what was on learn.microsoft.com. Hypothesis: this service seems to be differentiated from learn.microsoft.com not in content but possibly in tracking and verification.</p>

<p>The lab Module 02 included instructions to create a VM in the cloud CLI using some bash script and some commands. But I don’t really understand the commands or steps. This is definitely a limitation of overbuilding the learning lab.</p>

<p>Mysteries: Why did bash need to create storage and resource group before it could be used? What is required to initialize a VM via cmd line. Isn’t it better to send a config containing all the VM specs? What process needs to be done to review requirements and confirm the VM specifications are adequate?</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>An interesting but not so challenging assignment. The problem solving required was nill. Every part of the instructions included a clickable icon and adequate direction to follow along mindlessly, no room to get stuck, read the docs, try out solutions and find a better way. On a scale of fluff to tough, this assignment was fine soft wool.</p>
